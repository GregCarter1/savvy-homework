    <h1>How I Got Here</h1>
    <p>As the Head of Operations in an infantry battalion, I had a vested interest in information.  To enable so many moving
      parts, and enable them to work together in harmony required that everyone has the same information, in a usable format,
      that is intuitive to find and interpret.  After writing a Information Management policy, we decided on using SharePoint
      as the platform.  By learning Sharepoint and creating libraries, webparts, workflows, lists, and forms; I realized that
      I really enjoy information technologies and creating/building solutions to operational problems.
